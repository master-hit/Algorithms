Do not use Vector, Hashtable, and Stack

1. [Array] = associates numerical indexes to objects. do not increase size after declared

2. [Collection] holds single elements. increases after declared
    2.1 [List] associates numerical indexes to objects
        2.1.1 [ArrayList] if you're doing a lot of random access
        2.1.2 [LinkedList] if you will be doing a lot of insertions and removals in the middle of the list.
            2.1.2.1 Stack
            2.1.2.1 Queue
    2.2 [Set] only holds one of each type of object
        2.2.1 [HashSet] provide maximally fast lookups,
            2.2.1.1 [LinkedHashSet] keeps elements in insertion order
        2.2.2 [TreeSets] keeps the elements in sorted order
3. [Map] holds associated pairs
    3.1 [HashMap] is designed for rapid access
        3.1.1 [LinkedHashMap] keeps its keys in sorted order, and provides rapid access with hashing
    3.2 [TreeMap] keeps its keys in sorted order. no so fast as HashMap
